LA-Computer-Vision-Lab-meetup
=============================

Coding and data for joint development of computer vision projects

  Our first project is to code up intrinsic calibration of a camera from one or more photographs taken by the camera.
  
  I took a couple of photos of a checkerboard pattern, using no zoom and 10x optical zoom, at correspondingly different distances from the pattern to the camera, and saved them here as .jpg files.
