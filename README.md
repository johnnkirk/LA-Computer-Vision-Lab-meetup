=============================

Coding and data for joint development of computer vision projects

  Our first project is to code up intrinsic calibration of a camera
from one or more photographs taken by the camera.
  
  At our second meetup today, I took a couple of photos
of a checkerboard pattern, using no zoom and 10x optical zoom,
at correspondingly different distances from the pattern to the camera,
and saved them here as .jpg files.
